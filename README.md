# UART-using-Verilog

In this project, we will be learning about Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter (UART), itâ€™s implementation using the concept of Finite State Machine (FSM) on Verilog, a Hardware Description Language where we can we design various digital logic designs according to our requirements.
